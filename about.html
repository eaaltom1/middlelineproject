  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p><strong>Middleline isn’t a company. It’s a correction.</strong></p>
  <p>We started with a simple observation: small towns weren’t dying. They were being ignored.</p>
  <p>The institutions we counted on — big business, distant government, flashy nonprofits — all got too far removed. What we needed was something closer. Something in reach.</p>
  <p>Middleline is the result. A blueprint for rebuilding dignity, ownership, and purpose — one town at a time.</p>
  <p>We don’t believe in trickle-down hope. We believe in <strong>earned momentum</strong>.</p>
  <p>This isn’t about returning to the past. It’s about <strong>carrying forward the parts worth keeping</strong>, and finally letting go of what never served us.</p>
  <p>We work with hands, minds, and neighbors. We build places where people know your name, know your work, and know <strong>you matter</strong>.</p>
  <p>No gimmicks. No saviors. Just commitment.</p>
