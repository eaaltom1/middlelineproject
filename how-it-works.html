  <h1>How It Works</h1>
  <h2>No jargon. No secrets. Just the system.</h2>
  <p>Middleline is built to be <strong>viable, replicable</strong>, and <strong>undeniably local</strong>.</p>
  <h3>The 5-Stage System</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Identify the Pressure Point</strong><br>Every town has one — housing, food, jobs, childcare, transit. We start where the pain is real and the solution is tangible.</li>
    <li><strong>Launch a Local Backbone</strong><br>One business. One trust. One shared asset. Something that proves the town can build for itself, not just wait.</li>
    <li><strong>Train People, Not Replace Them</strong><br>We hire local. We cross-train. We upskill. We make workplaces people believe in, not just endure.</li>
    <li><strong>Reinvest Before Scaling</strong><br>No fast expansion. We stabilize first. Profits cycle into ownership structures, not out-of-town accounts.</li>
    <li><strong>Link Towns into a Support Grid</strong><br>We don’t just fix one place — we connect the dots. Shared logistics. Shared media. Shared defense against being bought out.</li>
  </ol>
