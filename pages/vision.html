  <h1>The Middleline Vision</h1>

  <p>

    Middleline was born from a simple idea: that dignity, decency, and ownership should be within reach—

    not reserved for the few. In towns like Heber Springs and beyond, we’re rebalancing the economy by replacing

    dependency with stewardship, and chains with trust.

  </p>

  <p>

    This isn’t about politics or utopias. It’s about giving people the tools, space, and freedom to build something

    better together—while keeping their identity and values intact.

  </p>

  <p>

    The goal isn’t to take over. The goal is to prove it’s possible. And to help other towns do it, too.
