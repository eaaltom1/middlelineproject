  <h1>Middleline: A Better Way Forward</h1>
  <p><em>Some things don’t need reinventing — just restoring.</em></p>
  <p>Middleline isn’t a movement. It’s a return. To towns that work. To jobs with dignity. To people you know by name.</p>
  <p>We’re not selling disruption. We’re building something that lasts.</p>
  <h2>What’s Wrong With the Current Model</h2>
  <p>Walmart didn’t destroy small towns on purpose. It just made it too easy to give up everything for a deal.</p>
  <h2>What We’re Doing Instead</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Keep What You Earn Where You Live</strong> – Profits stay put. Community grows.</li>
    <li><strong>Make Work Matter</strong> – We build businesses with dignity, not just jobs.</li>
    <li><strong>Build Town-to-Town Support</strong> – A chain of communities with each other’s backs.</li>
    <li><strong>Reclaim Culture</strong> – We’re pro-meaning, not anti-modern.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>This Isn’t a Party. It’s a Promise.</h2>
  <p>Middleline doesn’t fly a red flag or a blue one. We’re here for anyone who wants to build where they live — not just survive.</p>
